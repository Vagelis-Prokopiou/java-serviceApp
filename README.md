# ServiceApp
An Android application, to help you manage the periodic maintenance of your vehicle.

## Usage
You have the following options:
- Run a check based on the kms you provided, and the current date.
- Update existing data entries.
- Add a new data entry.
- Check the available data entries.

The app draws the data from an included "data.cvs" file.

You have to update the values of the file to match the specs of your vehicle. This will be done through the app.

Enjoy.
